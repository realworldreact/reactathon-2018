    "talkTitle": "Welcome + Reasons React was created",
    "talkDescription": "React revolutionized the way we build modern user interfaces. But before it took off, it was built to solve a few key problems when building apps for the web. In this short talk, we'll learn what those problems were and how React approached solving them.",

    "talkTitle": "Why React?",
    "talkDescription": "As the Frontend Platform team at Eventbrite switched from Backbone/Marionette over to React, it had to convince other developers, managers, directors, and non-engineers that React was the right path. And the rationale for moving wasn‚Äôt just because React is insanely popular. There are many tangible benefits that make the effort of migrating worthwhile. New to React and want to learn a little about how it works? Seeking ammunition to convince your team to make the change? Come learn about why we made the decision to transition to React, through an introduction of how to build user interactions with React.",

    "talkDescription": "JSX is an XML-like syntax extension to JavaScript, popularized by React. When seen for the first time it can often elicit bad memories of intermixing HTML and code, but JSX is *very* different! Let's learn exactly what it is, how it works, and even how you can use it outside of React.",

    "talkTitle": "How to learn React",
    "talkDescription": "Learning to build React apps can be confusing. React is a library, but even more than that, React is an ecosystem of tools that you piece together to create a program. This is a powerful property of the React community, however that ecosystem can be frustratingly distracting when you‚Äôre a newcomer trying to get your feet wet. The key to avoiding this frustration and confusion is to learn React (and its ecosystem) in the right order. In this talk, we‚Äôll go over what that order is and give a roadmap so you can have a vision of where you‚Äôre going. Let‚Äôs learn how to React!",

But, with so many CSS in JS solutions, how do you know which one to choose? In this talk, I will cover five different ways to style your React projects, and the pros and cons of each approach. From CSS Modules with SASS to Styled Components, you‚Äôll learn how each library works so that you know which one(s) best fits your needs.",

    "talkDescription": "The promise of writing code for iOS and having it ‚Äújust work‚Äù out of the box on Android is a tempting one. That along with hot reloading code and the ability to push over the air updates to published apps make React Native a tempting proposition. This sounds too good to be true so what‚Äôs the catch? React Native is a framework for building native apps using Javascript. Many native developers rightly associate hybrid Javascript apps with disappointing consumer experiences and frustrating development environments. Over the years the same promises have been made by many other Javascript based frameworks, so why is React Native any different? This talk will be from the perspective of an experienced iOS developer who has been working with React Native for the last 2 years and has shipped several cross platform apps with it.",
