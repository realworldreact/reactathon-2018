    "talkTitle": "Welcome + Reasons React was created",
    "talkDescription": "React revolutionized the way we build modern user interfaces. But before it took off, it was built to solve a few key problems when building apps for the web. In this short talk, we'll learn what those problems were and how React approached solving them.",

    "speakerBio": "Brian is a developer at Netlify (https://www.netlify.com), where he was first hired to convert their Angular app to React. Since then he has been working heavily on multiple React apps using Redux, GraphQL/Apollo, and a variety of solutions for styling. In his spare time, he mentors new programmers towards contributing in open source as well as JavaScript and React tools.",

    "talkTitle": "Why React?",
    "talkDescription": "As the Frontend Platform team at Eventbrite switched from Backbone/Marionette over to React, it had to convince other developers, managers, directors, and non-engineers that React was the right path. And the rationale for moving wasn’t just because React is insanely popular. There are many tangible benefits that make the effort of migrating worthwhile. New to React and want to learn a little about how it works? Seeking ammunition to convince your team to make the change? Come learn about why we made the decision to transition to React, through an introduction of how to build user interactions with React.",

    "talkDescription": "JSX is an XML-like syntax extension to JavaScript, popularized by React. When seen for the first time it can often elicit bad memories of intermixing HTML and code, but JSX is *very* different! Let's learn exactly what it is, how it works, and even how you can use it outside of React.",

    "speakerBio": "Feather started her career at Accenture as a technical consultant in various Silicon Valley companies including Sun Microsystems, Robert Half, and Electronic Arts. She went on to work as a Java developer for various startups that didn’t survive the first dot.com meltdown. After this she left the tech world to have a career as a working artist for several years. She returned to teach a web development bootcamp in both NYC and SF for General Assembly. She then went on to work as a full stack developer at Netflix for the next few years, and is now a front end developer at Nvidia. She lives in San Jose with her partner and the cutest dog on earth.",

    "talkTitle": "How to learn React",
    "talkDescription": "Learning to build React apps can be confusing. React is a library, but even more than that, React is an ecosystem of tools that you piece together to create a program. This is a powerful property of the React community, however that ecosystem can be frustratingly distracting when you’re a newcomer trying to get your feet wet. The key to avoiding this frustration and confusion is to learn React (and its ecosystem) in the right order. In this talk, we’ll go over what that order is and give a roadmap so you can have a vision of where you’re going. Let’s learn how to React!",

    "talkDescription": "React has no standard way to style components. A slew of ideas and frameworks have grown out of the community. But, with so many CSS in JS solutions, how do you know which one to choose? In this talk, I will cover five different ways to style your React projects, and the pros and cons of each approach. From CSS Modules with SASS to Styled Components, you’ll learn how each library works so that you know which one(s) best fits your needs.",

    "talkDescription": "The promise of writing code for iOS and having it “just work” out of the box on Android is a tempting one. That along with hot reloading code and the ability to push over the air updates to published apps make React Native a tempting proposition. This sounds too good to be true so what’s the catch? React Native is a framework for building native apps using Javascript. Many native developers rightly associate hybrid Javascript apps with disappointing consumer experiences and frustrating development environments. Over the years the same promises have been made by many other Javascript based frameworks, so why is React Native any different? This talk will be from the perspective of an experienced iOS developer who has been working with React Native for the last 2 years and has shipped several cross platform apps with it.",
